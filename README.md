#ShuffleCards
============

ShuffleCards implementation in C++

## Probleme Statement

You have a deck containing X number of cards. While holding the deck, do the following:

    a. Take the top card off the deck and set it on the table  
    b. Take the next card off the top of desk and put it on the bottom of the deck in your hand.  
    c. Continue doing (a) and (b) until all the cards are on the table.  

>**This is a round.** 

Pick up the deck and repeat steps (a), (b), ( c ) until the deck is in the original order. 

Write a program to determine how many rounds it will take to put the deck back in original order. Please make sure the program can take a command line argument for number of cards in deck. We will test the solution with different sizes of decks e.g. 100, 200, 300, 313.
